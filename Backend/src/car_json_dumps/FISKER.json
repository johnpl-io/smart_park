               "The Fisker patented EVer\u2122 technology uses an electric generator and battery pack to power the dual electric motors to drive the wheels, giving the Karma a range of up to 50 miles of electric driving. After 50 miles, the internal combustion gasoline engine engages to support the electric motors for an additional range of 250 miles. (Note": "the plug-in hybrid is never run by the engine. The engine provides the energy to run the electric motors).\n\nMotors: Two rear-mounted electric traction motors, mid-mounted lithium ion battery pack and front/mid-mounted range-extending gasoline engine/generator set\n\nBattery: 20 kWh, 180 kW lithium ion w/Nanophosphate\u2122 technology (A123 Systems)\n\nRange-extending gasoline Engine/Generator set: 2.0-liter, 260hp, low-emission, four-cylinder direct fuel-injection w/ turbocharger (GM Ecotec) and 175 kW generator\n\nTraction motors: 403 hp (300 kW) total [2 x 201.5 hp (150 kW)]\nTorque: 981 lb.-ft (1300 Nm)\nTransmission: Single-ratio gearbox/Limited Slip Differential combination\n\n\nThe Fisker Karma\u2019s efficiency has been assessed by Technischer \u00dceberwachungs Verein (T\u00dcV), Europe\u2019s recognized automotive certification agency, with the vehicle achieving a combined cycle figure of 135 UK mpg (2l/100 km or 112 US mpg) and a CO2 emission figure of 51 grams per km.\nThe extended range electric vehicle has also had its all-electric range of 51.6 mils (83 km) validated. As for the Sport mode driving, this brings a combined fuel economy of 31 UK mpg (9.2 liters per 100 km or 25.8 US mpg)."
